<em>Fantastic background job processing for JavaScript and TypeScript.</em>

# JSJobs #
JSJobs is a job queue and processing service for NodeJS applications. Using
Redis as a background store, JSJobs allows you to offload long-running jobs away
from your web application and handles all the rough edges involved: job
scheduling, handling failures and retries, priority queueing, the works. It's
designed to make developers and operators alike happy to use it and above
everything else JSJobs just wants to get out of your way so you can get your
work done.

It's pretty cool, and I'm excited that you're here to check it out.

## Documentation ##
JSJobs has a pretty extensive [wiki] that discusses its goals, its use cases,
and pretty much everything you'd want to know about it.

## JSJobs Pro: the Commercial Version ##
JSJobs is a full-featured piece of software as-is, but as projects and companies
grow there are features that enable those projects to accomplish common tasks
that are nevertheless tricky to implement at a larger scale. I like to think of
**JSJobs Pro** as a package that empowers developers with more options for
powerful, flexible jobs, and the upcoming **JSJobs Enterprise** (slated for
release sometime in 2018) will give system administrators and devops engineers
more options for safely, reliably, and securely running jobs related to your
products.
